# 1. What is the Internet?

**The Internet is a global network that connects millions of computers and devices, allowing them to communicate and share information using standard communication rules called protocols.**

**It lets people access websites, send messages, share data, and use online services from anywhere in the world.**

*The Internet is not the same as the Web.*  
The **World Wide Web** is a service that runs on the Internet. The Web is made of websites and pages; the Internet is the underlying network.

## **1.1 History & Concepts of the Internet**

The Internet has evolved from a small research experiment into a global network that powers modern life. Below is a timeline-style breakdown of how it all began and how it continues to grow.

### **Early Ideas (1960s)**

- The concept of a global computer network first emerged in the **1960s**.
- The U.S. Department of Defense developed **ARPANET** (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) in **1969**.
- Its main purpose was to allow computers in different locations to communicate, even if parts of the network failed.

### **ARPANET Grows (1970s)**

- Researchers designed the essential communication rules known as **TCP/IP** (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol).
- In **1983**, ARPANET officially adopted TCP/IP, forming the foundation of today’s Internet.
- More universities, laboratories, and government institutions joined the network, expanding connectivity.

### **Birth of the World Wide Web (1990s)**

- In **1990**, Tim Berners-Lee created the **World Wide Web (WWW)**, transforming how people accessed information.
- He introduced:
  - **HTML** – the language used to build webpages  
  - **URLs** – the addressing system for locating resources  
  - **HTTP** – the protocol used to access web pages  
- By **1993**, the release of the browser **Mosaic** made the web easily accessible to the public.
- The Internet grew rapidly as homes and businesses began going online.

### **Broadband & Social Media Era (2000s)**

- High-speed Internet (broadband and Wi-Fi) became widely available.
- Websites evolved into powerful platforms and services.
- This era saw the rise of:
  - **Google**
  - **Facebook**
  - **YouTube**
  - **Twitter**
- Online shopping, streaming platforms, and cloud services became mainstream.

### **Mobile & Smart Devices (2010s–Present)**

- Smartphones made the Internet portable and accessible anywhere.
- Smart devices (IoT) connected everyday objects such as watches, cars, and home appliances to the Internet.
- Internet speeds improved dramatically with **fiber**, **4G**, and **5G** technology.

## 1.1.1 ARPANET and the birth of packet switching  

### Why ARPANET Was Created?

During the **Cold War**, the U.S. needed a communication system that could survive potential failures or attacks. Traditional networks relied on a single continuous circuit, if one part failed, the whole system could collapse.  
ARPANET was designed to be **decentralized**, allowing data to reroute around damaged or busy areas.

### Key Figures Behind ARPANET

- **Leonard Kleinrock** — pioneered the theory of packet switching and helped shape early ARPANET design.
- **Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn** — later developed **TCP/IP**, the universal communication protocol that still powers the Internet today.

### Packet Switching vs. Circuit Switching

| **Circuit Switching (Old Telephone Systems)**  | **Packet Switching (ARPANET Innovation)**  |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Uses a dedicated line between two points.      | Breaks data into small chunks called **packets**. |
| If the line breaks, communication stops.       | Packets can take different routes to reach the destination. |
| No reassembly needed data flows in order       | Receiving device **reassembles packets** in the correct order, checks for errors, and requests missing packets if needed. |
| Inefficient for digital data.                  | More reliable, flexible, and efficient. |


*This idea made large scale computer networking possible.*

### The First Four ARPANET Nodes (1969)

1. **UCLA** – First node and first message sent  
2. **SRI** – Received the first ARPANET message  
3. **UCSB** – Third node added  
4. **University of Utah** – Fourth node to join the network  

These four formed the backbone of the very first Internet-like system.

### ARPANET → NSFNET → Internet

- **ARPANET (1969–1980s):** Began as a military research network.
- **NSFNET (1980s):** Expanded ARPANET into a larger academic and scientific network funded by the National Science Foundation.
- **The Internet (1990s–present):** Adoption of **TCP/IP (1983)** unified all networks, creating the global Internet we use today.

## 1.1.2 Evolution from TCP/IP to the modern Internet

The modern Internet as we know it would not exist without the development and adoption of **TCP/IP**, the protocol suite that standardized how networks communicate. Understanding this evolution gives us insight into how disparate networks became a single global network.

#### Early Network Protocols: NCP, UUCP, and Predecessors
Before TCP/IP, networks used a variety of protocols that were often **incompatible**.  
- **NCP (Network Control Protocol):** The protocol used on ARPANET in the early 1970s for host-to-host communication. It allowed basic message passing but lacked a universal addressing scheme.  
- **UUCP (Unix-to-Unix Copy Program):** Enabled file transfers and email between UNIX systems over serial lines and modems. UUCP worked for specific networks but could not scale globally.  

These protocols were functional but limited; connecting multiple networks required a universal standard.

#### TCP/IP Architecture: RFC 791 & RFC 793
The breakthrough came with **TCP/IP**, designed by **Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn** in the 1970s.  
- **RFC 791 (IP - Internet Protocol):** Defined how data is addressed and routed across networks. It introduced the concept of **packets**, each carrying source and destination addresses.  
- **RFC 793 (TCP - Transmission Control Protocol):** Added reliability by ensuring that packets arrive **in order** and without errors. TCP also handles retransmissions, flow control, and connection management.

TCP/IP’s **layered architecture** allowed networks of different types to interoperate, forming the backbone of the global Internet.

#### Flag Day: Transition on January 1, 1983
On **January 1, 1983**, ARPANET officially switched from NCP to TCP/IP a milestone called the **“flag day.”**  
- All hosts on the network had to adopt TCP/IP simultaneously.  
- This transition unified multiple experimental networks into a **single standardized protocol suite**, laying the foundation for the Internet.

#### TCP/IP Becomes Universal
After 1983, TCP/IP spread rapidly:  
- Academic networks, government research networks, and commercial networks adopted it.  
- Its flexibility allowed it to support new applications like email, file transfer, and eventually the **World Wide Web**.  
- TCP/IP’s **end-to-end model** simplified network design, allowing networks of any type (wired, wireless, satellite) to interconnect.

#### Evolution of Protocols: HTTP, IPv6, and Beyond
TCP/IP is still at the core of the Internet, but the protocols built on top of it have evolved:  
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Introduced in 1990, enabled the Web. Later versions, **HTTP/2** and **HTTP/3**, improved speed and reliability.  
- **IPv6:** Developed to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, providing virtually unlimited unique addresses.  
- **Other protocols:** DNS, SMTP, FTP, and emerging protocols like **QUIC** and **WebRTC** continue to expand Internet capabilities.  


## 1.1.3 ISPs, IXPs, and the global Internet structure

The Internet is not just a cloud in the sky it is a **complex, hierarchical network of networks**. Understanding how ISPs, IXPs, and global infrastructure connect billions of devices is key to appreciating how the Internet actually works.

#### Internet Service Providers (ISPs): Connecting Users
**ISPs** are companies or organizations that provide Internet access to homes, businesses, and other networks.  
- **Consumer ISPs**: Provide broadband or mobile Internet to households. Examples: Comcast, AT&T, Vodafone.  
- **Business/Enterprise ISPs**: Provide dedicated high-speed connectivity for organizations and data centers.  

ISPs assign IP addresses, manage routing, and ensure users can reach websites and services anywhere in the world. They are the **first step in Internet access**.

#### Internet Exchange Points (IXPs): The Hubs of Traffic
**IXPs** are physical infrastructure where multiple networks **interconnect and exchange traffic** without going through third-party networks.  
- This reduces latency, improves speed, and lowers transit costs.  
- Large IXPs exist in major cities worldwide, such as **DE-CIX (Frankfurt), LINX (London), and AMS-IX (Amsterdam)**.  
- IXPs allow local traffic to stay local, reducing the load on long-distance connections.

#### Tiered ISP Structure: Tier-1, Tier-2, Tier-3
The Internet is structured hierarchically:  
- **Tier-1 ISPs**: Global networks that can reach every part of the Internet **without paying for transit**. They peer with each other to exchange traffic freely. Examples: AT&T, NTT, CenturyLink.  
- **Tier-2 ISPs**: Regional providers that buy transit from Tier-1 ISPs but may peer with other Tier-2 ISPs. They connect local networks and provide access to Tier-1 for long-distance traffic.  
- **Tier-3 ISPs**: Local ISPs that provide Internet directly to homes and small businesses, typically purchasing transit from Tier-2 providers.

This hierarchy ensures efficient routing and connectivity across regions and continents.

#### Peering and Transit Agreements
- **Peering**: Two ISPs agree to exchange traffic **directly** at no cost, usually at an IXP.  
- **Transit**: An ISP pays a higher tier provider to carry traffic to parts of the Internet it cannot reach via peering.  

These agreements form the economic and technical backbone of global Internet traffic.

#### How Traffic Flows Between Continents
- Internet traffic often travels through **undersea fiber-optic cables** connecting continents.  
- Large data centers and IXPs act as **interconnection hubs**, ensuring traffic is routed efficiently.  
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) like **Cloudflare and Akamai** cache content near users to reduce latency and congestion.  

This combination of hierarchical ISPs, IXPs, and submarine networks makes the Internet resilient, scalable, and global.


## 1.1.4 Internet governance: IETF, ICANN, W3C, etc.

The Internet might feel like a “free-for-all,” but behind the scenes, a variety of organizations **coordinate standards, policies, and technical infrastructure** to ensure it works reliably and fairly. This coordination is known as **Internet governance**.

#### Key Organizations and Their Roles

- **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)**  
  - Develops the **technical standards** that make the Internet interoperable.  
  - Publishes **RFCs (Request for Comments)**, which define protocols like **TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP**, and many others.  
  - Operates openly and collaboratively, allowing anyone to contribute ideas or feedback.  

- **ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)**  
  - Oversees the **Domain Name System (DNS)** and IP address allocation.  
  - Ensures that **domain names are unique** and coordinates the distribution of IP blocks through Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).  
  - Maintains global DNS root servers, which are critical for resolving domain names to IP addresses.  

- **W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)**  
  - Develops **web standards** such as **HTML, CSS, and accessibility guidelines**.  
  - Ensures that web technologies are interoperable across browsers and platforms.  
  - Promotes **open, accessible, and international** web development.  

- **ISOC (Internet Society)**  
  - Advocates for **open development and governance** of the Internet.  
  - Supports initiatives that promote connectivity, security, and sustainability worldwide.  

- **IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)**  
  - Manages **global IP address pools, DNS root zones, and protocol parameters**.  
  - Operates under ICANN’s oversight.  

- **RIRs (Regional Internet Registries)**  
  - Distribute IP addresses regionally (e.g., **ARIN** in North America, **RIPE NCC** in Europe, **APNIC** in Asia-Pacific).  
  - Ensure fair allocation and manage local Internet number resources.  

#### How Decisions Are Made

Unlike a traditional organization, **the Internet is not centrally controlled**. Governance relies on:  
- **Open, consensus-based decision-making**: Anyone can participate in IETF working groups or W3C committees.  
- **Multistakeholder model**: Governments, private sector, academia, and civil society all contribute.  
- **Transparency**: Meetings, proposals, and drafts are publicly documented.  

This collaborative approach balances technical efficiency, global coordination, and the openness that has made the Internet a universal platform.


## 1.1.5 Domain names, DNS hierarchy, and IP address allocation (RIRs)

The Internet’s ability to connect billions of devices relies on a **structured addressing system** and a way to map human-readable names to numeric addresses. This is where **domain names, the DNS hierarchy, and IP address allocation** come into play.

#### Hierarchical DNS Structure

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is like the Internet’s phonebook. It translates human-readable domain names (like `example.com`) into IP addresses (like `93.184.216.34`). DNS is hierarchical, meaning it’s structured in levels.

![DNS Hierarchy](https://github.com/ZAO-01/internet/blob/main/assets/dns-hierarchy.png)

### **a) Root Level**

* **What it is:** The top of the DNS hierarchy.
* **Function:** Points to **Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers**.
* **Example:** The `.` in `www.example.com`.

### **b) Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**

* **What it is:** The next level down in the hierarchy. Examples include:

  * **gTLDs (generic TLDs):** `.com`, `.org`, `.net`
  * **ccTLDs (country code TLDs):** `.us`, `.uk`, `.jp`
* **Function:** Direct queries to the authoritative servers for second-level domains.

### **c) Second-Level Domains**

* **What it is:** Directly under TLDs, usually the main name you register.

  * Example: In `example.com`, `example` is the second-level domain.
* **Function:** Managed by individuals or organizations who register the domain via registrars.

### **d) Subdomains**

* **What it is:** Domains under the second-level domain.

  * Example: `blog.example.com` or `mail.example.com`
* **Function:** Can point to different servers/services (web, email, etc.).

### **e) Hostnames**

* **What it is:** The actual machine or service on the subdomain.

  * Example: `www` in `www.example.com`
* **Function:** Maps to a specific IP address.

#### Who Manages Each Layer

| Level               | Example           | Function                        | Controlled By                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Root                | `.`               | Directs to TLD servers          | ICANN / IANA                                 |
| Top-Level Domain    | `.com`, `.uk`     | Directs to second-level domains | ICANN (gTLDs), national authorities (ccTLDs) |
| Second-Level Domain | `example.com`     | Managed by registrant           | Domain owner via registrar                   |
| Subdomain           | `blog.example.com` | Points to service/server        | Domain owner                                 |
| Hostname            | `www`             | Maps to IP address              | Domain owner / network administrator         |

#### Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)

IP addresses are allocated through **Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)**, which manage resources within specific regions:

- **ARIN** — North America  
- **RIPE NCC** — Europe, Middle East, Central Asia  
- **APNIC** — Asia-Pacific  
- **AFRINIC** — Africa  
- **LACNIC** — Latin America and the Caribbean  

RIRs ensure **fair and efficient distribution of IP addresses** and maintain public records of allocations.

#### IPv4 Exhaustion and IPv6 Allocation

- **IPv4 addresses** are 32-bit, allowing ~4.3 billion unique addresses, which have largely been exhausted due to global growth.  
- **IPv6** uses 128-bit addresses, providing a virtually unlimited number of IP addresses.  
- RIRs are now responsible for **allocating IPv6 addresses** and managing transition strategies for IPv4 depletion, ensuring the Internet can scale for billions more devices.
